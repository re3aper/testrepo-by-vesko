      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>SFP#22: All about "Public Money? Public Code!" with Johannes Näder</h1><p>
In our 22nd Software Freedom Podcast episode, we talk with Johannes Näder, Senior Policy Project Manager at the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), about "Public Money? Public Code!".
</p><p>
The "Public Money? Public Code!" initiative advocates for public bodies to switch to Free Software instead of spending tons of money on proprietary software. The reasons for "Public Money? Public Code!", how the initiative has evolved over the years, and how the FSFE defines its role as a watchdog within the initiative are discussed with Johannes in this episode.
</p><p>Johannes has been involved with Free Software since the 1990s. In November 2022, he turned his passion for Free Software into his daily bread and started working for the Free Software Foundation Europe. He is, among other responsibilities, the current coordinator of the FSFE’s "Public Money? Public Code!" initiative.</p><p>If you have not heard of this initiative yet, or if you don’t know how best to get involved, check out our new Software Freedom Podcast episode and learn all about "Public Money?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>SFP#19: Why we need Free Software on medical devices with Karen Sandler</h1><p>
For this episode Bonnie Mehring met with Karen Sandler to talk about 
her relationship with Free Software. Karen depends on a medical device 
to keep her heart working. This led her to become an advocate for 
Free Software in medical devices.
</p><p>
In her daily life Karen relies on a defibrillator to help her 
heart work properly. Like many medical devices this defibrillator uses 
proprietary software. Therefore Karen had to put software into her body 
over which she has no control in order to let her heart keep working. In 
this episode Bonnie Mehring talks to Karen about the problems that are 
occuring with non-free medical devices and why it is important to have 
Free Software on them. What happens to people when their support ends 
when the company that manufactures their devices goes bankrupt? And what is the 
connection with Dick Cheney?</p><p>Listen to Karen and Bonnie talk about the importance of Free Software on medical devices and find out more about 
Karen's heartwarming story of software freedom.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>SFP#17: Citizen participation through Free Software with Petter Joelson</h1><p>
In this 17th episode of the Software Freedom Podcast Matthias Kirschner and Petter Joelson uncover how Free Software can be a tool for citizens to actively participate in their local community. Petter invites you into the world of Decidim and explains what citizen participation should look like.
</p><p>
Petter Joelson is the director of <a href="https://digidemlab.org/">Digidem Lab</a>, a Swedish NGO that works on improving citizen participation according to the UN Global Goals for Sustainable Development. One of the tools they promote and work with is the Free Software participation platform <a href="https://decidim.org/">Decidim</a>. Decidim was originally developed by the city of Barcelona and is today widely used. With this episode the Software Freedom Podcast invites its listeners to dive into the world of citizen participation, how it could be done, what  hurdles are on the way, and – in line with our <a href="https://publiccode.eu">"Public Money? Public Code!"</a> campaign – how publicly financed software can help administrations across Europe.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>SFP#12: Enforcement of the GNU GPL with Till Jaeger</h1><p>
    With our 12th episode of the Software Freedom Podcast we dig into the
    history and the beginning of enforcing Free Software licences, especially
    the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). Together with Till Jaeger, who has
    been working alongside Harald Welte for enforcing the GNU GPL in the first
    court cases in Germany, we talk about the long way we have come since those
    early days.
  </p><p>
    Our guest, Till Jaeger, discusses with our host, Matthias Kirschner, how the
    decision to go to court and stand up for the rights of copyleft licences
    came about. Till and Matthias tell an exciting story about those first steps
    on this new legal ground. They also highlight the short term and long term
    impacts of the first court decision in favour of Free Software. For example,
    how more and more information about licensing and especially using a Free
    Software licence became available and publicly known. But also how
    workshops, like the FSFE's yearly <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ln/llw.html">Legal
    and Licensing Workshop</a>, were created for those interested in using and
    being compliant to Free Software licences.
  </p><p>Discover together with us the changes that have come from those first steps
    to the acceptance of Free Software in companies. Till has been involved with
    Free Software licensing for a long time and provides a deep and well rounded
    insight into the history of enforcing the GNU GPL. To give this episode a
    perfect ending, Matthias and Till also talk about some of the most common
    misunderstandings of Free Software licensing. This is the perfect episode
    for everyone to get an insight into one of the most important events in the
    history of enforcing Free Software licences.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>SFP#11: REUSE Booster and our update on REUSE with Max Mehl</h1><p>
Max Mehl and Bonnie Mehring talk about the REUSE initiative and the newly launched REUSE Booster programme. This 11th episode of the Software Freedom Podcast is the perfect match for you if you are interested in Free Software licensing and curious about how REUSE and its tools make that easier for developers and users.
</p><p>For this episode we have invited Max Mehl. This is the first time since the launch of the Software Freedom Podcast that a FSFE staff member joins the podcast. Max Mehl, an FSFE programme manager, has been with the FSFE since 2011 and has worked on numerous campaigns. These include the <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ilovefs/">"I Love Free Software Day"</a>, <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/android/">"Free Your Android"</a>, <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/routers/">"Router Freedom"</a>, and the <a href="https://publiccode.eu">"Public Money? Public Code!"</a> campaign, just to name a few. Nowadays, Max Mehl is also the person responsible for the <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE initiative</a> and one of the REUSE tool's maintainers.</p><p>REUSE is a standard for modern licensing of Free Software projects. It is widely adopted and has been implemented by large Free Software communities like KDE. In this episode Bonnie Mehring and Max Mehl talk about REUSE itself and its tools, the development of the REUSE community and the newly launched <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2021/news-20210609-01.html">REUSE Booster</a> programme, which is the perfect opportunity for an easy entrance to adopting the REUSE standard for your software project. With this episode Bonnie Mehring and Max Mehl provide a nice and easy entrance to the very complex world of software licensing. </p><p>Read more:</p><ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>SFP#10: How to support Free Software and a sustainable digital infrastructure</h1><p>
In our 10th episode of the Software Freedom Podcast we talk with Elisa Lindinger from Superrr Lab. Together we discuss problems faced by Free Software projects and how to tackle them. In a broader frame we discover what would be needed for a more sustainable digital infrastructure and talk about the work Elisa does for this aim.
</p><p>
For this episode Matthias Kirschner and Bonnie Mehring talk with Elisa Lindinger about the survey <a href="https://recommendations.implicit-development.org/">Roadwork ahead</a>, which evaluates the needs of those working for software freedom and a digital infrastructure for the public. What concrete actions are needed to create sustainable Free Software communities and projects? How could developers spend more time on coding and not so much time on organising events and finances, in short how could community management be better organised? And how could those who do volunteer work for open infrastructure and Free Software receive the support they need? Those are just some of the questions discussed in the podcast. All of those problems are brought into a broader sense of this topic, when we talk about how our digital civil society can be more sustainable. We discuss the four claims Elisa and her team developed and advocate for:</p><ol>
<li>Digital civil society needs to be part of political discussions about digital policy,</li>
<li>New methods are needed of support and funding,</li>
<li><a href="https://publiccode.eu">"Public Money? Public Code!"</a> should be a guiding principle for public procurements and Open Data, Open Access and Open Source should be the base for public contracts,</li>
<li>A commitment for long-time support of  widely-used software, libraries and protocols is needed to ensure their maintenance.</li> 
</ol><p>Together, we discuss what a sustainable digital civil society can look like and what is still needed for this aim to be reached. This episode provides knowledge and insights for all of you who want to support Free Software and create a long-lasting digital society.</p><p>Read more:</p><ul>

For the seventh episode of our Software Freedom Podcast we talk with Vincent Lequertier about transparency, fairness, and accessibility as crucial criteria for artificial intelligence (AI) and why it is important for our society to release AI software under a Free Software license.
</p><p>
Our guest for the seventh episode of the Software Freedom Podcast is Vincent Lequertier. Vincent is a member of the Free Software Foundation Europe and is researching AI in the health care sector. Together we discuss the use and development of artificial intelligence from a Free Software perspective. Vincent explains what AI actually is and why it is important for our society to release AI software under a Free Software license. We discuss why the criteria of transparency, fairness and accessibility are important when working with artificial intelligence and how they relate to Free Software. Finally, we also discover what challenges AI is facing in the future and whether we should be afraid of the increasing use of this technology in our daily lives.

For our Software Freedom Podcast we talk with people who have inspiring ideas about software freedom. In this special episode, we talk with Dr. Luis Falcón and Dr. Axel Braun about the Free health and hospital information system GNU Health.</p><p>Unfortunately, as we had to do this podcast remotely this time, we cannot provide the same level of audio quality as you are used to in this podcast. We apologise for this and will look into
better solutions for remote recordings for future episodes.</p><p>
In this special episode of the Software Freedom Podcast we talk about some of the advantages of <a href=" https://www.gnuhealth.org">GNU Health</a> and how as a Free health and hospital information system it can and already does help with the current Covid-19 pandemic. Our guests are Dr. Luis Falcón who is the author of GNU Health and Dr. Axel Braun who published the first live CD of GNU Health. We discover how and why Dr. Luis Falcón got the idea for the software and what are the next steps in the development of GNU Health, how it is financed and where it is already being used. Together we speak about the importance of a Free health and hospital information system and why <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">public code</a> is essential in the public health care sector during the Covid-19 crisis and beyond. This is the perfect episode for an overview of how important Free Software is in the current situation and especially in hospitals and the public health system.

For our Software Freedom Podcast we talk with people who have inspiring ideas about software freedom. In this episode, we talk with Professor Lawrence Lessig, founder of Creative Commons, about regulation of society, offline as well as online, about the different means of regulation, and shed light on regulations through code.</p><p>
This fifth episode of the Software Freedom Podcast covers the complicated topic of regulation. Our guest is Professor Lawrence Lessig from the Harvard Law School. Lessig is a former board member of the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, as well as founder and present Board member of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. Lessig has published several books, including the influential and often-quoted <a href="http://www.codev2.cc/">"Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace"</a>. In this episode we discuss with Professor Lessig the different types of regulation that affect society both online and offline, such as laws, norms, the market, or architecture. In this respect we also touch upon code as a means of regulation. Enjoy learning about the positive and negative effects that some of these regulations can have on society, as well as the further development of ideas.

In the monthly Software Freedom Podcast we talk with people who have inspiring ideas about software freedom. In this episode, we talk with Carmen Bianca Bakker about the REUSE project. By this we are covering the very broad topic of software licensing and the problems there, which REUSE is able to solve with three simple steps.
</p><p>
 With the first episode of 2020 and the fourth episode of the Software Freedom Podcast we aimed at the broad and sometimes complicated topic of software licensing. For this we invited Carmen Bianca Bakker who is together with Max Mehl working on the <a href="https://reuse.software">REUSE project</a>. The REUSE project helps with the licensing of software by making licensing easy for humans as well as for machines. Together with Carmen we discuss the problems that occur with licensing, talk about the REUSE tool and the next steps in its development.

</p><p>
One of the main topics this year was and still is the coming implementation of the 5G standard. There were long debates, and several countries have taken steps to ban specific vendors. These countries are even trying to convince others to do likewise. To allow enough room for this broad issue and include an expert's point of view, we dedicate a full Software Freedom Podcast episode to discuss this with Harald Welte. Harald is a Free Software developer known for his involvement in OpenMoko, the first Free Software phone; his work for gplviolations.org to make sure companies adhere to the obligations of Free Software licenses; and nowadays his work on the umbrella project "Open source mobile communications", or Osmocom for short.</p><p>Together with Harald, we give you an overview of the use of Free Software in mobile phone communication; talk with you about the basics of this technology; about the difference of 3G, 4G, and 5G; the Huawei ban and <a href="https://osmocom.org/">Osmocom</a>; as well as about the state of Free Software in those fields.</p><p>Read more:</p><ul>

  SFP#2 about KDE with Lydia Pintscher
</h1><p>
 We are back with the second episode of our Software Freedom Podcast! 
 Once a month, we talk with people who have inspiring ideas about 
 software freedom. In this episode, we talk with Lydia Pintscher from 
 KDE about the development of the KDE community, the different KDE projects 
 and the issues they will be tackling over the next two years. 
</p><p>
 When we were planning this second episode of the Software Freedom Podcast,
 we were keen on inviting someone from the Free Software community. We 
 thought that Lydia, as the current Vice President of KDE, would be the 
 perfect person to join us for our second episode. This gives us the chance 
 to introduce to you the wonderful KDE community and all its different projects. 
 In this episode, we talk about how Lydia balances her day job with the 
 volunteer position of vice president of KDE. We also discuss some broader 
 topics like the development of the KDE community and the different projects 
 they are working on, as well as the future outlook of these projects.

  SFP#1 on Day Against DRM with Cory Doctorow
</h1><p>
  We have a Podcast! Starting with this episode, we will talk once a
  month with people who have inspiring ideas about software freedom. In
  our first episode of our Software Freedom Podcast, we address the
  issue of Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) together with Cory
  Doctorow, a British-Canadian writer, political activist, and
  co-editor of the blog boingboing.net. Cory Doctorow is a prominent
  supporter of software freedom and a less restrictive copyright law.
  His books are published under Creative Commons licenses.

  When we planned the first episode, we exchanged some ideas for
  possible guests. When we heard that the <a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm/2019">Day
  Against DRM</a> will take place in October we thought: we have to get
  Cory Doctorow as our first guest on Digital Restrictions Management.
  In this episode of the Software Freedom Podcast, we talk about the
  difference between books and an e-books with DRM, how authors and
  artist can make money without DRM, security implications of DRM,
  regulation of the so called "Internet of Things", and other questions
  related to this issue.
